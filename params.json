{"tagline":"Open, Distributed, Decentralized Social Networking Protocol","google":"UA-34661894-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"# Why?\r\n\r\nAs much as Twitter is a great social networking platform, it's also a silo. And it's getting more and more closed every day - witness the new API limitations.\r\n\r\nYou don't own your Tweets (or your Facebook status messages). If you wanted to create some kind of competitor or co-operator with Twitter, there's no federated protocol to have tweets stored elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd (so far) it looks like the promising young upstarts in the Social Networking world are going to go the same way.\r\n\r\nThis is stupid.\r\n\r\nIf email had been built this way, everyone would get their email by logging in to email.com (or, let's be realistic, http://something-clever-with-email-and-dropped-vowels.io). And we'd pretty much be held hostage to that one system. Hell, they might not even allow third-party email clients from accessing their service, if they were to follow Twitter's example.\r\n\r\nWhy can't Social networking work more like Email? Well, that's what we're proposing.\r\n\r\n# Objectives\r\n\r\n##1) Federated\r\n\r\nDifferent Socialite.io network providers should be able to interoperate. If one goes down, the entire network should not go down.\r\n\r\n##2) Minimal\r\n\r\nOnly the basic fundamentals of what different social networks needs to provide are specified. Many things will be left unspecified, and extension mechanisms will be made available so that the market can bubble-up the best solutions.\r\n\r\n##3) Secure by default\r\n\r\nSpam in the early days of social networks was very bad. The various social networking providers have built complex and powerful anti-spam solutions. Having had experience with protocols that under-specified security (SMTP! I'm talking to you) we will ensure that secure communications will be possible, and spam will be able to be at least mitigated.\r\n\r\n##4) Oriented towards mobile\r\n\r\nMost social networking traffic currently takes place on mobile devices. We expect this trend to continue. The protocol will be built to expect this.\r\n\r\n##5) Modular\r\n\r\nThe protocol suite will be a set of several different specifications. Implementors will be free to use only the parts they need.\r\n\r\n##6) Hobbyist-friendly\r\n\r\nDevelopers should be able to host their own socialite.io feed on their own server, if they want.\r\n\r\n#Sample implementation\r\n\r\nA sample implementation - *not* a reference implementation, just a sample - will be provided.","name":"Socialite.io"}
